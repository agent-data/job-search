# Multi-Harness Portability — Adapter Layer + Per-Platform Distribution

> **How this plan was produced.** A 57-agent research workflow inventoried every Claude-Code coupling
> in the repo (193 found), designed an adapter per target harness, and adversarially verified each
> mapping and scheduling claim. The findings — the complete coupling inventory, the per-platform
> adapter table, the neutralization pattern per kind, the scheduling matrix, and every unverified
> claim — live in the companion design doc
> [`design-docs/multi-harness-portability.md`](../../design-docs/multi-harness-portability.md)
> ("the dossier"). **This plan points at the dossier for detail; it does not restate the inventory.**
> The dossier supersedes the Codex-only [`codex-portability.md`](../../design-docs/codex-portability.md).

## Goal

Generalize job-search from a Claude-Code-only product into an **agent-harness-agnostic** one, by
introducing a thin per-platform **adapter layer** and shipping a hand-committed manifest per harness —
the proven superpowers pattern: one `skills/` tree read in place, no per-platform bundle emission, no
codegen. Agent-consumed prose stops naming Claude tools inline and instead speaks in **actions** that
defer the harness-specific literal to the active platform's adapter, which each skill self-selects (the
agent knows its platform). Codex is **live-verified end to end** (it is the only target installed here);
Cursor, opencode, Gemini, Copilot, Factory Droid, and Pi are emitted and **structurally validated**,
with every runtime claim flagged for an install-time pin (dossier §6). The one product-behavior change
is the **relaxed scheduling rule**: a native local consent-based scheduler where one exists, else a
**consent-gated** machine cron/launchd schedule as the sanctioned fallback (never silent, never cloud).

## Non-goals

- **No per-platform bundle emission or codegen.** Distribution is manifest-only — one tree, read in
  place (dossier §1, §7). `build.sh` keeps its single job (fanning `shared/references/` into skills);
  it gains a subdir copy, not a transform step. The dossier's `<active>`-resolution framing is
  **rejected** in favor of self-select (see Decision log).
- **No live verification of the six uninstalled harnesses.** Codex is the only live lane
  ([[live-data-for-all-tests]]); the rest are structural-only until installed. Every runtime claim for
  them ships with an inline "pin on install" marker (dossier §6c).
- **No rewrite of completed exec-plans, and no new product behavior** beyond the relaxed-cron rule.
- **No agent-data CLI fork.** `init` has no `--codex/--cursor/…` selector; the `--api-key`-only path is
  the sanctioned workaround (dossier §5). File the upstream ask; do not vendor or patch the CLI.
- **No flat edits to the four hand-authored references** in isolation — they must be neutralized in the
  **same pass** as their shared-tree siblings or the repo ships contradicting copies (dossier §2, §6d).
- **The Claude build must stay behaviorally byte-identical.** The Claude adapter restores today's exact
  strings; if any Claude-path behavior changes, the task is wrong.

## Done when

All hold, run from repo root:

- [ ] `python3 scripts/doc_lint.py --root .` → clean
- [ ] `python3 -m pytest -q` → green
- [ ] `python3 scripts/philosophy_guard.py` → green (the `fast|balanced|high` rename adds no score/credit field)
- [ ] `./scripts/build.sh` then `git status --porcelain skills` → empty (the `references/platform/` subdir syncs; no hand-edited bundles)
- [ ] **Claude byte-identity:** with `platform/claude.md` active, a cross-read reproduces today's `/loop` recipe, the four onboarding `AskUserQuestion` choices, the `haiku|sonnet|opus` buckets (as legacy aliases), and the `claude -p` exit-0 rule verbatim
- [ ] **Neutralization complete:** `grep -rEl 'AskUserQuestion|/loop|claude -p|\b(haiku|sonnet|opus)\b|init --claude-code' shared/references skills` returns **only** `platform/claude.md` (and dev-only docs) — no inline Claude tokens in neutralized prose
- [ ] **The four hand-authored refs** (`onboarding.md`, `scheduling-and-consent.md`, `home.md`, `customization.md`) carry no stale verbatim copy contradicting the shared tree
- [ ] **Style-guide conformance:** every neutralized agent-consumed file cross-reads clean against [`prompt-style-guide.md`](../../design-docs/prompt-style-guide.md)
- [ ] **Live Codex proof:** `codex exec` runs the search pass against **real** agent-data and returns real matches + writes a digest (transcript in Progress log)
- [ ] **Scheduling reconciled:** belief #7 + its eval, `SECURITY.md`, and `conventions.md` `schedule.time` no longer assert the blanket no-cron prohibition — all defer to the two-tier rule
- [ ] **All 7 manifests parse and every adapter resolves its cross-references** (structural lane green)
- [ ] `codex-portability.md` reconciled (CI-gate error fixed, dist-bundle framing corrected, marked superseded)

## How to execute

Per [`docs/PLANS.md`](../../PLANS.md): task-by-task, one scoped Conventional-Commit per task, appending
to the Progress log (and Decision log for judgment calls). **Hard ordering: the build mechanism (P0)
and the Claude adapter (P1) land before any prose neutralization** — every adapter cross-reference
dangles until `build.sh` syncs `platform/` and `platform/claude.md` exists (dossier §6d). Tests here are
mostly doc-lint / build / grep / eval gates rather than pytest, since the surface is prose + manifests.
**Workflow-orchestrated phases** (P1 neutralization, P2 the four refs + SKILL bodies, P5 the six
platforms) fan out one agent per file/platform through a *neutralize → adversarially-verify-against-the-
style-guide* pipeline, worktree-isolated where agents mutate files in parallel. Run the Done-when gate
before flipping `state: completed`.

---

## P0 — Codex live spike (prove the whole pattern on real hardware) · [BLOCKS]

The cheapest end-to-end proof: one tree + one manifest + one adapter + real agent-data on the Codex
already installed here (`codex-cli 0.140.0`).

- **T0.1 [BLOCKS] — Teach `build.sh` to sync the adapter subdir.** Add a copy of
  `shared/references/platform/*.md` into each skill's `references/platform/`. *Red:* a stub
  `shared/references/platform/_probe.md`, `./scripts/build.sh`, assert it appears under
  `skills/*/references/platform/` and `git status skills` shows it. *Green:* the two-line loop addition.
  Keep the existing flat copy untouched.
- **T0.2 [BLOCKS] — Author `shared/references/platform/codex.md`.** From dossier §1/§3/§4: Run recipe
  (`codex exec` one-off; Automations recurring in local project mode), tool map, scheduling (Tier-1 App
  / Tier-2 pure-CLI cron), headless (`codex exec`, real exit codes), agent-data setup (`--api-key` only),
  model tiers (`fast→gpt-5`-class, `high→gpt-5-codex`/o-series), closed-choice fallback (numbered prose),
  block-alert channel (App Triage / CLI none). Style-guide conformant.
- **T0.3 [BLOCKS] — Add `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`** beside `.claude-plugin/`, `skills: "./skills/"`
  pointing at the same tree (dossier §1). No codegen.
- **T0.4 [BLOCKS] — Live proof.** Point Codex at the tree (drop into `~/.agents/skills/` or via the
  manifest), run a live `codex exec` of the search pass against real agent-data, confirm real postings +
  a written digest. Record the command + outcome in the Progress log ([[live-data-for-all-tests]] — no
  mocks). If `multi_agent` is off, detail-reads run sequentially — acceptable; note it.

**Phase done-when:** a real Codex run returns real matches with only the Codex adapter + manifest +
the `--api-key` auth path; `build.sh` clean.

## P1 — Adapter layer + Claude adapter, Claude build byte-identical · [BLOCKS]

- **T1.1 [BLOCKS] — Author `shared/references/platform/claude.md`** capturing **today's exact strings**:
  `/loop <interval> /job-search:job-search-run` + the hour-unit quirk, namespaced-vs-loose, the
  `AskUserQuestion` mechanism, `claude -p` exit-0, the Write tool + never-shell-redirection, the
  `haiku|sonnet|opus` ids, desktop notify, `init --claude-code`. This file is the byte-identity anchor.
- **T1.2 [BLOCKS] — Neutralize the six `shared/references/*.md`** to speak in actions and defer to
  `references/platform/<your-platform>.md`, applying the 11 patterns (dossier §3). *Per file:* red = a
  grep that finds the inline Claude token; green = an action + adapter pointer, the literal moved to
  `platform/claude.md`. **Workflow-orchestrated:** one agent per file → verify-against-style-guide stage.
  *Verify:* `./scripts/build.sh && git status skills` empty; the Claude reading reproduces today's
  behavior (byte-identity cross-read); `doc_lint` clean; style-guide cross-read (Note 1).
  `agent-data-contract.md` is already agnostic (dossier §2) — skip.
- **T1.3 [BLOCKS] — Repoint the skills' inline tool mentions** to "your platform's adapter
  (`references/platform/<name>.md`)" so the agent self-selects. No `<active>` placeholder ships (Decision
  log).

**Phase done-when:** Claude behavior byte-identical; evals green; build clean.

## P2 — Neutralize the four hand-authored refs + the SKILL bodies · [BLOCKS]

The dossier's blind-spot fix — these are **not** synced by `build.sh`, so each is edited in place.
**Workflow-orchestrated** (one agent per file, verify pipeline).

- **T2.1 [BLOCKS] — `skills/job-search/references/onboarding.md`** (densest file): the ~6
  `AskUserQuestion` choices, `init --claude-code` → adapter `agent_data_init_flag`, the
  `agent-data.dev/setup/claude-code.md` URL, the `!`-bang affordance, the `≥2.1.0` version gate, the
  `/loop` §7 recipe, the namespaced slash (dossier §2).
- **T2.2 [BLOCKS] — `skills/job-search-agent/references/scheduling-and-consent.md`** — rewrite around the
  two-tier relaxed rule (defer mechanism to the adapter; **preserve** the cloud-rejection rationale as
  the test any scheduler must pass).
- **T2.3 [TUNE] — `home.md`** (status line `daily via /loop` → adapter schedule label; model tiers;
  `/loop` compose/run) and **T2.4 [TUNE] — `customization.md`** (model tiers; subagent fan-out).
- **T2.5 [BLOCKS] — The five `SKILL.md` bodies** — defer inline tool names; turn the literal **"Claude
  reads this brief"** in `job-preference-interview` (written into user-facing `preferences.md`) into a
  generic agent reference (dossier §2).
- **T2.6 [BLOCKS] — `docs/product-specs/new-user-onboarding.md`** — also hard-codes `init --claude-code`
  (found this session; the dossier missed it). Parameterize to the adapter flag.

**Phase done-when:** the neutralization grep (Done-when) returns only `platform/claude.md`.

## P3 — Scheduling relaxation across beliefs / security / conventions · [BLOCKS]

The relaxed rule's real teeth — three doc contradictions the dossier surfaced (§4).

- **T3.1 [BLOCKS] — `core-beliefs.md` belief #7 + its eval** — re-scope "the harness forbids
  crontab/launchctl writes" → "asserts no **silent/un-consented** write; a shown, user-approved Tier-2
  line is allowed." Keep the consent intent; generalize the mechanism. Update the verify-step so a green
  eval stops enforcing the lifted prohibition.
- **T3.2 [BLOCKS] — `docs/SECURITY.md` §"Scheduling never writes your machine"** — make it conditional
  on the active mechanism (Tier 1 installs nothing; Tier 2 = consent-gated, shown, user-removable).
- **T3.3 [TUNE] — `conventions.md` `schedule.time`** — no longer "informational under `/loop`"; it **is**
  honored by a wall-clock cron/launchd fallback. Defer to the adapter.

## P4 — UX degradations (model tiers · question UI · notify · headless exit)

- **T4.1 [BLOCKS] — Model-tier migration.** Config + prose carry `fast|balanced|high|inherit`; the
  adapter "Model tiers" table maps each token to the host's model id. **Breaking config change:** accept
  legacy `haiku|sonnet|opus` as aliases (the loader/onboarding maps them) so live `config.yaml` does not
  break (dossier §3, §6d). *Verify:* `philosophy_guard` green (confirmed: it scans no model names).
- **T4.2 [TUNE] — Closed-choice question.** `voice.md` keeps the agnostic decision (closed-choice vs
  prose; no tool name in user text); the adapter owns structured-picker-vs-numbered-prose per host;
  skills keep authoring the words and swap the verb.
- **T4.3 [TUNE] — Desktop-notify demotion.** The durable guarantee is the **two file-backed channels**
  (blocked digest + home-view record); the alert becomes capability-gated (adapter "Block-alert
  channel"). Honest, not a weakening — it was already conditional in the live code (dossier §3).
- **T4.4 [TUNE] — Headless exit-code per host.** Record-based surfacing stays primary everywhere; the
  adapter "Headless invocation" pins `exit-code-trustworthy (yes/no + consequence)`. The five
  `evals.json` exit-code expectations **branch on the platform under test** (Claude=0, Codex=non-zero),
  never flat-swap (dossier §6d).

## P5 — The six remaining platforms + structural validation + framing · workflow-orchestrated

- **T5.1 [BLOCKS] — Per-platform adapters** `platform/{cursor,opencode,gemini,copilot,droid,pi}.md` from
  dossier §1/§4, with every unverified item carried inline as a **"pin on install"** marker (dossier §6c).
  Fan-out, one agent per platform.
- **T5.2 [BLOCKS] — Per-platform manifests** (worktree-isolated fan-out): `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
  (omit superpowers' dead `agents/`/`commands/` pointers); `.opencode/plugins/job-search.js` + a **new**
  root `package.json` (none exists today — dossier §6b); `gemini-extension.json` + `GEMINI.md`
  (`@`-importing the front-door skill + `gemini-tools` adapter); Copilot **reuses** the Claude manifest
  + the `COPILOT_CLI` session hook; Factory Droid via `.claude-plugin` compat (or `.factory-plugin/`);
  Pi via a `package.json` `pi` block.
- **T5.3 [TUNE] — Per-harness entry files** pointing at `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` stays the Claude-only
  redirect; `AGENTS.md` is already a regular file, **not** a symlink — dossier §6b).
- **T5.4 [BLOCKS] — Structural validation + CI.** A lane that parses every manifest, lints each adapter
  table, and resolves every `platform/<name>.md` cross-reference; the Codex live lane; structural-only
  lanes for the six. Extend `doc_lint` for the `platform/` subdir.
- **T5.5 [TUNE] — Framing generalization.** `AGENTS.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` "Claude Code as a job-search
  OS" → "an agent harness as a job-search OS"; the OS-model **Cron** row → the two-tier rule.
- **T5.6 [TUNE] — Reconcile `codex-portability.md`.** Fix the CI-gate error (it is **not** in `ci.yml`),
  correct the `dist/`-bundle framing to the in-place pattern, align its scheduling resolution with the
  relaxed rule, and mark it `superseded` by the dossier; update `design-docs/index.md`.

## Progress log

- **T0.1 + T0.2** — taught `build.sh` to sync `shared/references/platform/*.md` into every skill's
  `references/platform/` (guarded glob, idempotent); added the Codex adapter
  `shared/references/platform/codex.md`. Red→green verified (0→5 skills carry the adapter); `doc_lint`
  clean, 56 tests green.
- **T0.3** — added `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (valid JSON; `skills: "./skills/"` → the same one tree,
  no per-platform bundle), harness-neutral description, job-search metadata reused from `.claude-plugin/`.
- **T0.4** — **live Codex proof.** `codex exec` (gpt-5.5) ran the real `job-search-run` skill against
  live agent-data and returned **10 real LinkedIn postings → 1 strong + 5 moderate matches + a written
  digest, exit 0** — with **no neutralization yet**, so the portable core runs as-is on Codex.
  Artifacts verified real (real companies/IDs/URLs, qualitative judgment with no scores, detail reads,
  a caught data discrepancy). Discovered + recorded the least-privilege sandbox egress config
  (`--sandbox workspace-write -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`) the dossier had flagged
  untested, and folded it back into `platform/codex.md`. **P0 complete.**

## Decision log

- **Self-select adapters, not build-time `<active>` resolution.** The dossier proposed the build resolve
  `platform/<active>.md` to one file. That re-introduces per-platform emission — the exact thing the
  manifest-only pattern avoids — because one built tree serves **all** platforms via their manifests.
  Instead every adapter ships in every skill (`build.sh` copies the `platform/` subdir) and skills point
  the agent at "your platform's adapter"; the agent self-selects, exactly as superpowers relies on. No
  `<active>` placeholder ships (avoids the H7 unresolved-template risk).
- **Manifest-only, zero-codegen distribution** for all seven (dossier §1) — supersedes
  `codex-portability.md`'s `build.sh`-emits-a-`dist/`-bundle recommendation.
- **Relaxed scheduling is two-tier and consent-gated** (Note 2): native local scheduler where one exists
  (install nothing); else a consent-gated cron/launchd schedule (shown, explicit yes, user-removable).
  Cloud schedulers never qualify — they can't reach the local workspace/auth. Captured in
  [[prefer-native-claude-features]].
- **Model buckets become portable tier tokens** (`fast|balanced|high|inherit`) with legacy
  `haiku|sonnet|opus` aliases for back-compat; `philosophy_guard` verified to scan no model names.
- **Codex Automations treated as Tier-1 local** on manual-text evidence (App/daemon, local project dir);
  the headless-server-box case stays an open "pin on install" (dossier §6a/§6c).
- **`docs/product-specs/new-user-onboarding.md` added to the agent-data-init scope** (T2.6) — a
  `--claude-code` site the dossier's repo-edit flag missed; found by grep this session.
- **The dossier is the design doc; this is the exec-plan.** Detail (the 193-coupling inventory, the
  per-platform tables) lives in the dossier and is pointed at, not restated, so this plan stays lean and
  does not rot (per PLANS.md).
- **Codex sandbox egress config is now verified, not a PIN** (P0): agent-data reaches the network from
  inside `codex exec` under `--sandbox workspace-write -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`
  (plain workspace-write blocks it). Resolves the dossier's "agent-data egress allowlist untested" risk.

## Self-Review

_(author's cold-read before execution — confirm every named file/command is real, the Non-goals and
Done-when gate fence the work, and the P0→P1 ordering holds; to be completed before the first commit)_
